Dear <%= @leader.name %>,

Good day to you.

We would like to remind you that currently you do not have any team members in your team. Here are some suggestions that we would wish to present to you: 
1. You can modify yout title or description of your project so that it looks more interesting to attract other participants.
2. Do not hesitate in contacting those participants in your Pending List.
3. If you really find it hard to form a team with your title, why not try to join other team and try to combine your ideas with them.

We wish you could enjoy forming your team and discussing with them.

Looking forward to seeing you and have a nice day ahead! 

Sincerely,
Committees of 3 Days of Code
